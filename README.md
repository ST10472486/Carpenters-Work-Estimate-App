General Overview:
An application that allows users more specifically carpenters to Select a task and the cost their materials and calculate how much they should be paid for their service based on
their number of working hours

Application Features:
A radio group that allows the selection of ONE task
Three checkboxes that will add any amounts that are checked with their assigned amounts per material
Text to enter the number of working hours
A Calcukate button to find the amount that the user should be paid
A Dsiplay showing the amount

Design Considerations
Implementations of linear Layouts both vertical and horizontal with padding to give a bit of depth as well as a virbrant colours for the UI to make all texts and buttons stand out

Error Handlimg
Messages will display under specific conditions such as RadionButton not being selected or the number of hours text being blank adn will request users to fill in those respective
inputs

Optimisation or additons:
The addition of a field to calculate the the hourly rate, inclusion of iamges based on certain seletec materials, more options for tasks and materials

Lessons Learned: 
I've both developed an understanding of the pair class and how the use of lists to optimise and easily create one field for mulitple variable in turn reducing length of code
and redundancy
